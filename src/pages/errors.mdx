# Errors

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Mistakes happen, and mostly they will be yours, not ours. Let's look at some status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use the error type and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging (before contacting support).

<Note>
  Before reaching out to support with an error, please be aware that 99% of all
  reported errors are, in fact, user errors. Therefore, please carefully check
  your code before contacting Protocol support.

## Status codes

<Row>
  <Col>
    Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the
    Protocol API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.
    <Properties>
      <Property name="200 - OK">Everything worked as expected.</Property>
      <Property name="201 - Created">
        A successful response of CREATE requests.
      </Property>
      <Property name="204 - No Content">
        A successful response of UPDATE or DELETE requests.
      </Property>
      <Property name="400 - Bad Request">
        The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
      </Property>
      <Property name="401 - Unauthorized">
        Username or password or bearer-token invalid.
      </Property>
      <Property name="403 - Forbidden">
        The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.
      </Property>
      <Property name="404 - Not Found">
        The requested resource doesn't exist.
      </Property>
      <Property name="422 - Unprocessable Entity">Validation Fails.</Property>
      <Property name="429 - Too Many Requests">
        Hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your
        requests.
      </Property>

## Error types

<Row>
  <Col>

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Protocol API will return an error response with an error type and message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

    Here is a list of the two error types supported by the Protocol API â€” use these to understand what you have done wrong.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="api_error">
        This means that we made an error, which is highly speculative and unlikely.
      </Property>
      <Property name="invalid_request">
        This means that you made an error, which is much more likely.
      </Property>
    </Properties>
